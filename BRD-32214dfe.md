# Technical Documentation: Modern Blog Platform

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for a modern blog platform built with FastAPI (backend) and React (frontend). The platform will allow users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts with images, and provide a clean, intuitive user interface.

**2. Goals**

* Develop a responsive and visually appealing blog platform.
* Implement robust backend APIs for blog management.
* Enable users to easily create, edit, and manage blog content.
* Provide a seamless image handling mechanism using URLs.

**3. Functional Requirements**

* **Blog Creation:**
    * Users can create new blog posts with a title, content (text), and image (provided as a URL).
    * The system should validate the input data (e.g., ensure the URL is valid).
* **Blog Reading:**
    * Users can view all blog posts on the homepage.
    * Each blog post should display its title, image, and a preview of the content.
    * Users can click on a blog post to view the full content.

    * Users can edit existing blog posts, including the title, content, and image URL.
* **Blog Deletion:**
    * Users can delete existing blog posts.
* **Image Handling:**
    * Images are provided via URLs.
    * The system should display images efficiently.
    * The system should validate the image url.

**4. User Interface (UI) Requirements**

        * Blog post title.
        * Short excerpt of the content.
        * "Read More" button.
    * Infinite scrolling or pagination for large numbers of blog posts.
    * **Blog Detail Page Background:** The blog detail page should have a background image with the following URL: "https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1684581214880-2043e5bc8b8b?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D".
* **Create/Edit Blog Page:**
    * Form with fields for:
        * Blog post title (text input).
        * Blog post content (rich text editor).
        * Image URL (text input).

* **API Endpoints:**
    * **GET `/blogs`:**
        * Retrieve all blog posts.
        * Response: JSON array of blog objects.
    * **GET `/blogs/{blog_id}`:**
